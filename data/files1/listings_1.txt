Look no further than these 12 awesome farmers markets, listed in no particular order.

The [Beauty Lake Trail](<https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/wyoming/beauty-lake-trail-wy/>) sure does live up to its name. Hike along this five-mile trail in Shoshone National Forest to take in the splendor of Beartooth Lake, Beauty Lake, and Crane Lake. The latter part of the trail can be a bit challenging, so if you're looking for an easier hike, just head back about two miles down the trail. This is easily one of the best day hikes in Wyoming.

Have you hiked any of the best day hikes in the US? Have any more suggestions for easy and scenic hikes in your home state? Let us know\! As always, before heading out on any hike, tell someone where you’re going and when you plan to return. It’s also incredibly important to be prepared for any type of weather since conditions can change quickly. I love wearing layers so I can modify them based on temperatures getting colder or warmer as the day goes on. Having the [right gear](<https://www.llbean.com/>) is vital for a great hike.
