# Farmers Market

The 2023 Little Rock Farmers Market is closed. To be added to the 2024 invite to register, please email FarmersMarket@littlerock.com.   
The Farmers Market makes its home in the River Market's two outdoor, open-air pavilions overlooking Riverfront Park and the Arkansas River.

### The Little Rock Farmers Market will open its 48th season on Saturday, May 6, 2023 and will be open every Saturday 7am-2pm, rain or shine, through Labor Day Weekend. Our Last Market Date will be Saturday September 2.

Since 1996, the Little Rock Farmers Market has made its home in the River Market’s two outdoor, open-air pavilions overlooking Riverfront Park and the Arkansas River. The Market is filled with farm-fresh produce as well as a bountiful array of locally prepared cottage foods, and handmade arts and crafts.

Many produce vendors at the market accept SNAP benefits \(look for the signage at their booths\). SNAP tokens can be purchased Farmers Market Managers Tent in the center of the Farmers Market. The Little Rock Farmers Market is also a proud participant in the Double Up Food Bucks \(DUFB\) program where patrons can have up to $20 worth of SNAP tokens matched for free to use at the market.

Parking is always free for Little Rock Farmers Market patrons. Visitors are invited to park in the lot behind the market as well as in the River Market Parking Deck at 2nd and River Market Avenue. Special VIP parking is available for senior and handicapped individuals. Just enter the parking lot off Ottenheimer and President Clinton Avenue, and the parking attendants at the kiosk will be happy to direct you to a nearby and accessible parking spot.
